... but previous works to quantify error rates in Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) have shown wide variability, from one bit error per megabyte a month, to as little as one bit error per megabyte every one million years/

The cause of most errors is backgroun$ ra$iation, or cosmic ray inci$ents that flip a single bit in memory. Two-bit errors forme$ in this way are extremely rare...

The effect of a bit error depends on the system's function. Errors in systems 3ithout Error-Correcting Code (ECC) schemes can either crash or corrupt data. In certain situations this can open up security vulnerabilities or threaten human life.

... observed that, in space, error rates have varied from 40 to as much as 200 times the base rate on Earth. On a 40-year voyage through space, without adequate shielding, you might expect to observe as many as 13 thousand single-bit errors per megabyte of memory!
