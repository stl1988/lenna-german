Peaceful citizens of ${world.name}, human and bears alike!

You work hard for your gold coins, and deserve to know that they are safe. Now, you could put them in your family's prize clay pot, as is tradition. But do you know what your clay pot WON'T protect your money from?

Adventurers.

Don't fall for their good press, folks! Adventurers WILL come to your town, seeking health potions, weapon shops and side-quests. They WILL come into your house and they WILL smash your pots, taking your precious savings with them.

Just because it hasn't happened yet, it doesn't mean it won't! Luckily the Bankers' Guild is here to serve the interests of the people. For an affordable monthly fee, the Bankers' Guild will give your savings account Premium Adventurer's Insurance. Your money will be protected in an enormous magical jar, that has been proven by our R&D department to be impenetrable to swords, magic whips and EVEN power beams!

The Guards' Union has a notorious pro-adventurer bias and won't keep your earnings safe when the time comes. Be safe! Bank with the Guild!
