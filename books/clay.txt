Ten years in the making, the seventh and final book in the critically-acclaimed Clay Series brings the story of our beloved clay-worker to a tragic and watery end.

All of Clayton's hard work and persistence in the previous book finally pays off! But is success really worth the trouble? 

As Clayton's latest pot design takes off, people come to him from far and away, bringing money and demands. At first, Clayton manages to keep up with their requests. His small business grows rapidly to a globe-spanning empire. But when an earthquake destroys a critical warehouse, crippling the company, people keep coming. The pressure to deliver becomes too much for poor Clayton. He must escape!

On a remote desert island, Clayton finds a brief respite... Until the apache helicopters, jetpack bears, and invisible cruise liners arrive! Feeling cornered and under pressure, he walks out into the ocean, and to his doom.

In total silence at last, Clayton speaks his final words--the answer to the question nobody asked--"actually, the pots just magic the poop away." But it was hard to hear him well since he was drowning at that point.

"I hope you enjoy the tale of Harried Potter and the Deadly Shallows!" -- J. K. Rollinginit, author, philanthropist, retroactivist.
