Yeah, yeah
All my skellies out there, it's time.
It's time, all my skellies out there.
Straight outta the dusty tombs of rap.

The price drops low, as does my profit.
I never sell, 'cause to sell is apposite.
Over the ocean, I found the World Wrap.
So listen up son, here comes the recap.

Hover potion, slow motion.
Forward motion, over ocean.
Law of motion: a false notion!
At the World Wrap, head back!

It isn't what you'd hope for; nothing like the folklore.
Puts you back at your front door.
Ain't nothin' worth an uproar.
