#{font:bold}Sweetheart Cupcakes#{font:default}

INGREDIENTS

130ml vegetable oil
130g brown sugar
1 tsp vanilla extract
2 tsp ground cinnamon
1 tsp bicarbonate of soda
2 large eggs
75g sultanas
150g diced hearts
grated zest from 1 orange
150g self-raising flour

METHOD

1. Heat oven to 180C.
2. Line an 8 hole muffin tray with paper cases.
3. Pour the oil, sugar, eggs and vanilla into a large bowl.
4. Mix together with a whisk.
5. Add the diced heart, orange zest and sultanas.
6. Stir in the cinnamon, flour and bicarbonate of soda.
7. Pour the mixture into the cases - it should be quite runny.
8. Heat in the oven for 18 minutes until firm.
9. Allow the cakes to cool to room temperature.
10. Top with whipped cream and serve!

For best results, adjust the recipe to match the type of heart you're using. Here are some suggestions:

- Bat heart cupcakes go well with a small glass of sweet plum wine.
- Bush hearts are quite sour on their own; omit the orange zest from your recipe.
- Hearts from broken rocks are often very dry. Consider adding an extra egg at the beginning, and if the mixture is not runny enough to pour into the cases, mix in extra water.
