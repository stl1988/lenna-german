Sometimes, in the dead of night
You fall asleep for the last time
Heart stops, and tissues decay
Skeletons move in the moonlight

Calcium are you
Calcium oh yeah
Calcium are you ahh

Now the dungeon is done
You had to go back home
Please come and spook me again
I've never felt more a-bone

Body, I ain't missing you
I'd rather have my spine
And my pelvic girdle too
Humans to slay!

I think about loot every day
I really want coins too
Death swept my feet right off the ground,
Profit's love I've found

Doctor Bones, Bones,
Calling Doctor Bones,
Doctor Bones, Doctor Bones,
Get up now
Wake up now
Doctor Bones, Bones,
Calling Doctor Bones,
Doctor Bones, Doctor Bones,
Wake up now
Wake up now
