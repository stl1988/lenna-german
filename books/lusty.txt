#{font:bold}Act I, Scene III#{reset}

Setting: dungeon boss room.

At rise: Archangel Martha is sprawled across the floor, helpless. Libby, with a triumphant expression, sits astride Martha. In one hand, she holds down two of Martha's main tentacles. In her other hand, she grips a dagger, which is pointed at the archangel's chest.

Archangel Martha:
#{font:smallcaps}I have been defeated. Cut the heart from my breast and eat it, as per tradition.#{reset}

Libby:
I will not.

(Libby tucks the knife away, and releases Martha's tentacles.)

Archangel Martha:
#{font:smallcaps}Then my heart shall always belong to you, mistress. For one cannot have one's heart and eat it too.#{reset}

Libby:
Come with me, Martha.


#{font:bold}Act II, Scene II#{reset}

Setting: in the corner of Libby's library, between two towering bookcases.

At rise: Libby is showing Archangel Martha around the library.

Archangel Martha:
#{font:smallcaps}Now I have seen the entire library, so that I may serve you better.#{reset}

Libby:
Not quite, Martha. There's one more rack I still need to show you...

Archangel Martha:
#{font:smallcaps}But mistress... what if your patrons were to chance upon us?#{reset}

Libby:
Then it won't just be the books getting checked out today.
